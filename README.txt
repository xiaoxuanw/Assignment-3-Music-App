A description of the creative portion of the assignment
* Describe your feature
We added a tab that features the Top artists on the chart. When the artist's image is clicked, you get a list of information of that artist. 
* Why did you choose this feature?
We chose this feature because we think that it'd be nice to see who is the hottest, most popular artists now on the chart. The user would be able to follow the recent trend and see if their favorite artist is on the top chart. By puttin the chart, users also get recommended of the best artists and would be able to explore more songs by artists on the top. 
* How did you implement it?
We used an API of top artists on the chart from Deezer and extract info from it with repository and interface. Then with an adapter, we send the info to the activity that sets up views.
